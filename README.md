## Repository description
This entire project repository only contains one single file [bhai.py](bhai.py). Other files are auxiliary. I have ignored the *modularity* principle in this project. But considering the benefits of collaborators, I have added sufficient documentation (doc strings) in the [bhai.py](bhai.py) file and divided the file into some specific code blocks.
- Imports
- Initializations
- Functions
- Main Loop
